Title: Project to deploy web app on aws -- on app if we put data it will get stored in rds 

Step1::::::::
Launch mysql RDS 
DB instance identifier - employee
Master username - admin
PW - password
public access - yes 
disable autoscaling 

Step2::::::::
Creation of s3 bucket 
bucket name - vijay1999gawate

Step3::::::::
Lunch ubuntu instance open all traffic --give iam role s3full access 
first edit config.py file add here all the parameters that we set while launching rds like endpoint, uname and pw
now, ssh into instance and clone the repo (aws-live)
install the mysql client with the help of below command 
then install python commands as below mentioned 
Now, on ec2 connect to mysql 
#mysql -h <rds_endpoint> -P 3306 -u admin -p
give pw you will be into mysql>
mysql> create database employee;
mysql> create table employee(empid varchar(20), fname varchar(20), lname varchar(20), pri_skill varchar(20), location varchar(20))
mysql> use employee 
Now , start your app with following command 
#sudo python3 Empapp.py
Now, copy public ip of ec2 and check the app 
on app if you put data of employee 
it will get reflected in S3 as well as in rds 
go to s3 and check there 
go to rds and check if the data comes in rds or not with the folowing command 
#select * from employee 

Step3:::::
Now, we are checking app with prublic ip but we want to assign domain name to our website 
We can create free domain on (www.freenom.com) sign up here 
services > register new domain 
vijay-aws -- check availabilty and select from here which is free 
domain name - vijay-aws.tk 
Now, services > my domain > manage domain > management tools > use custom nameservers (enter below)

Now , go to aws route53 service 
create hosted zone here 
domain name = vijay-aws.tk
create 
it will create NS record 
you will get 4 value in NS , copy this fields on freenom > use custom nameservers 
Now, create record set 
name == wwww
value = public ip of instance 

Result:::::::
Now if you put www.vijay-aws.tk in browser you will see your website
